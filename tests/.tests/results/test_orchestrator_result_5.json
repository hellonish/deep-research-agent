      "title": "2. Core Business & Mission",
      "markdown": "Aegis AI's primary product is an AI-native email security platform designed to replace legacy Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) [1]. The platform's mission is to empower 'defenders' with fully automated email security that eliminates the need for manual tuning, rule configuration, or the laborious process of chasing phishing reports [1].\n\n### Primary Products and Services\nAegis AI offers a comprehensive suite of AI-powered email security features delivered as a service. Key offerings include:\n*   **Advanced Phishing & Social Engineering Detection:** Automated detection of evolving phishing and social engineering attacks [1].\n*   **Business Email Compromise (BEC) Prevention:** Stopping executive impersonation, invoice fraud, vendor compromise, and wire fraud by analyzing context, intent, and communication anomalies [1].\n*   **Zero-Day Attack Resilience:** Real-time identification of new phishing campaigns, even those leveraging trusted infrastructure or not yet in threat feeds [1].\n*   **Intelligent Spam Detection:** AI-powered filtering with a focus on minimizing false positives [1].\n*   **Malware & Ransomware Protection:** Detection and remediation of malicious files [1].\n*   **Automated Incident Response:** Instant quarantine and remediation of threats without manual intervention [1].\n*   **Executive Security Dashboards & Reporting:** Real-time visibility into threats and C-suite-ready reports [1].\n\n### Problems Solved for Customers\nAegis AI addresses several critical pain points for security teams and organizations:\n1.  **Ineffectiveness of Traditional SEGs:** Legacy systems fail against sophisticated, AI-generated, and zero-day attacks due to their reliance on static rules and signatures [1]. Aegis AI's adaptive AI agents overcome this by analyzing hundreds of signals like a human analyst [1].\n2.  **High False Positive Rates:** Traditional filters often generate numerous false positives, leading to 'alert fatigue' and increased workload for Security Operations Center (SOC) teams [1]. Aegis AI boasts a >90% reduction in false positives [1].\n3.  **Complex Deployment and Management:** Traditional SEGs require MX record changes, hardware, network modifications, and extensive policy configuration [1]. Aegis AI offers instant, MX-free API integration, deploying in minutes [1].\n4.  **Resource Drain on SOC Teams:** Manual investigation and response to email threats consume significant SOC resources [1]. Aegis AI automates these processes, allowing security teams to focus on strategic initiatives [1].\n5.  **Lack of Real-time Adaptability:** Attackers constantly evolve their tactics. Aegis AI's multi-agent architecture continuously adapts to new threats in real-time, providing resilience against emerging attack patterns [1].\n\n### Business Model\nWhile not explicitly detailed as a subscription model on the website, the nature of a 'platform' offering continuous, always-on protection, API integration, and automated services strongly suggests a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business model [1]. Customers likely subscribe to the Aegis AI platform, paying for access to its advanced AI agents and security features, with pricing potentially based on the number of users or mailboxes protected. The emphasis on 'faster deployments' and 'eliminating complexities' points to a value proposition centered on efficiency, superior protection, and reduced operational overhead for security teams [1].",

      "title": "3. Technical Architecture & AI Stack",
      "markdown": "Aegis AI's technical architecture is fundamentally distinct from traditional email security solutions, built around a 'Multi-Agent AI Architecture' and leveraging cutting-edge machine learning techniques [1].\n\n### Multi-Agent AI Architecture\nThe core of Aegis AI's platform is an orchestrated system of independent and collaborative AI agents [1]. These agents are designed to be 'always-on' and continuously adapt to new threats in real-time, providing comprehensive coverage [1]. This agentic approach allows for distributed intelligence, where different agents might specialize in various aspects of threat detection (e.g., sender behavior analysis, content analysis, anomaly detection) and then collaborate to form a holistic assessment of an email's threat level [1]. This contrasts sharply with monolithic, rule-based systems that often have rigid, predefined logic.\n\n### Large Language Model (LLM) Based Detection\nA critical component of Aegis AI's stack is its utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) for threat detection [1]. Unlike static rules or signatures, LLMs enable the system to understand the nuances of natural language, context, and intent within email communications [1]. This capability is crucial for detecting sophisticated attacks such as Business Email Compromise (BEC), executive impersonation, and highly personalized spear phishing, where the malicious intent is often embedded in the linguistic structure rather than overt indicators [1]. The LLM-based detection is described as 'self-learning,' meaning it can adapt and improve without constant manual tuning, moving beyond the limitations of predefined patterns [1]. The system analyzes 'sender behavior, language intent, and hundreds of other signals' to identify threats that bypass traditional filters [1].\n\n### Autonomous Threat Detection\nThe platform operates without reliance on predefined rules or signatures, automatically detecting phishing, BEC, and zero-day attacks [1]. This autonomy is achieved through the real-time analysis capabilities of its AI agents, which can identify new attack campaigns instantly, even if they leverage trusted infrastructure or haven't been added to threat feeds [1]. This is particularly effective against 'no-payload phishing' and 'Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM)' attacks [1].\n\n### Instant API Integration\nFor deployment, Aegis AI utilizes native API integration with major email platforms like Google Workspace and Microsoft 365 [1]. This 'MX-Free Deployment' eliminates the need for complex network changes, hardware, or MX record modifications, allowing for rapid integration, often within minutes [1]. This API-first approach signifies a modern cloud-native architecture, prioritizing ease of deployment and minimal disruption to existing IT infrastructure [1].\n\n### Cloud Infrastructure & Data Pipelines\nWhile specific cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) are not explicitly mentioned, the 'instant API integration' and 'cloud-native' implications strongly suggest deployment on a major cloud platform [1]. The processing of 'hundreds of signals' and 'real-time analysis' implies robust, scalable data pipelines capable of ingesting, processing, and analyzing vast quantities of email metadata and content efficiently [1]. The mention of SOC 2 Type II certification and encryption for data in transit and at rest indicates a strong focus on data security and privacy within their infrastructure [1]. They also state they 'never stor[e] full email content beyond what is necessary for analysis' [1].\n\n### Illustrative Code Snippet: LLM-based Email Analysis (Conceptual)\nAn AI Engineer at Aegis AI might work on developing or refining components that leverage LLMs for email analysis. Below is a conceptual Python snippet demonstrating how an LLM might be used to classify an email's intent, a core part of their threat detection capabilities.",
