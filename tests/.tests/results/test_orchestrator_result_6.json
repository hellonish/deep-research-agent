      "title": "Introduction to Agentic AI",
      "markdown": "Agentic AI represents a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, moving beyond the capabilities of traditional generative models to exhibit semi- or fully autonomous functions. These systems are designed to perceive their environment, reason about information, and act independently to achieve predefined goals [1]. Unlike conventional chatbots that primarily engage in interactive dialogue to solve problems, Agentic AI integrates seamlessly with various software and digital ecosystems, enabling it to execute complex, multi-step tasks with minimal human intervention [1]. This evolution signifies a shift towards AI systems that can not only generate content but also make decisions and perform actions akin to a human agent within a given context [1].",

      "title": "Defining Agentic AI: Core Characteristics and Functionality",
      "markdown": "At its fundamental level, Agentic AI is characterized by a tripartite operational framework: perception, reasoning, and action [1].\n\n*   **Perceive:** Agentic AI systems are equipped to understand and interpret information originating from both digital and physical environments. This involves processing diverse data inputs to form a coherent understanding of the current state [1].\n*   **Reason:** Following perception, these systems engage in sophisticated reasoning processes. This includes analyzing the perceived information, making informed decisions, and formulating strategic plans to achieve their designated objectives. The reasoning component allows for complex problem-solving and goal-oriented planning [1].\n*   **Act:** The culmination of perception and reasoning is the ability to act. Agentic AI executes multi-step plans and interacts with various digital or physical systems. This often involves leveraging standard building blocks such as Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to communicate effectively with other agents, human users, or external services. These actions can encompass tool use, engaging in economic transactions, and strategic interactions within their operational domain [1].\n\nJohn Horton, an associate professor at MIT Sloan, describes AI agents as \"autonomous software systems that perceive, reason, and act in digital environments to achieve goals on behalf of human principals, with capabilities for tool use, economic transactions, and strategic interaction\" [1]. These capabilities significantly enhance large language models (LLMs) by enabling them to automate intricate procedures, execute multi-step plans, utilize external tools, and interact dynamically with digital environments, thereby serving as powerful components within broader workflows [1].",

      "title": "Distinction from Generative AI",
      "markdown": "While generative AI has revolutionized content creation by automating the production of complex text, images, and video based on human language prompts, Agentic AI extends this by actively making decisions and performing actions in a manner that mimics human agency [1]. The key differentiator lies in the 'action' component; generative AI creates, while Agentic AI perceives, reasons, and then acts upon its environment to achieve a goal [1].\n\nSinan Aral, another MIT Sloan professor, further refines this distinction by defining \"AI agents\" as individual autonomous systems. In contrast, \"agentic AI\" refers to more complex systems that orchestrate multiple, distinct agents working collaboratively to accomplish a task. An illustrative example of agentic AI could be a marketplace where various agents represent different buy and sell sides in a negotiation, coordinating their actions to reach an optimal outcome [1].",

This involves careful consideration of how agents interact and communicate within a collaborative environment.\n*   **Human-Centered Decision-Making:** Agentic AI systems can sometimes struggle with handling exceptions or nuanced situations. It is imperative that their decision-making processes are carefully aligned with human-centered approaches to ensure ethical and contextually appropriate outcomes [1].\n*   **Irregular Reliability and Unethical Behavior:** There are inherent risks of agents making faulty decisions, such as incorrectly rejecting a loan application, or even exhibiting unethical behavior. To mitigate these risks, it is essential to ensure explainable business decisions and consistent application of ethical standards across all agent operations [1].\n*   **Cybersecurity Concerns:** As AI agents are granted permissions to access diverse datasets and enterprise systems, robust, permission-based security systems become paramount. Protecting these systems from unauthorized access and potential breaches is a critical challenge [1].\n*   **Accountability:** In autonomous workflows with minimal human supervision, clearly delineating responsibility when Agentic AI makes errors or causes harm is a complex issue. This necessitates the establishment of governance boards and the delegation of specific monitoring responsibilities to ensure accountability [1].",
