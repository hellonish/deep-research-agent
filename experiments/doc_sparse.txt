Technical specification: API rate limits.

Our API uses the following limits:
- REST: 100 requests per minute per API key.
- WebSocket: 5 connections per account.
- Error code 429 indicates rate limit exceeded.
- Include the X-RateLimit-Remaining header in responses.

For SDK integration, see the section "Rate limiting" in the developer docs.
Reference: RFC 6585 (additional HTTP status codes). Use exponential backoff when you receive 429.
